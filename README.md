# Bear Maps, version 4.0

## Intro
This is a web application that resembles the features of Google Map including **map rastering**, **routing(finding the shortest path)**, **autocomplete searching** and **navigation direction** functions.

## Data Structure and Algorithm Built from Scratch
* KDTree & Priority Queue: [proj2ab](https://github.com/davidyen-888/bearmap/tree/master/proj2c/bearmaps/proj2ab)
* A* Search: [hw4](https://github.com/davidyen-888/bearmap/tree/master/proj2c/bearmaps/hw4)
* Trie: [lab9](https://github.com/davidyen-888/bearmap/tree/master/proj2c/bearmaps/lab9)

## Usage
### Zooming 
Supports zooming in and out by either clicking on the magnifier button, using keyboard +/- or scrolling the mouse.

### Routing
First, **double tap** any location to set the start point, and **double tap** another location to set the goal. The shortest path will appears as a blue route in the map. 

Second, click on the direction button can see the navigation directions steps by steps from the start to the goal with estimated distances.

Last, click on the **clear route button** before next path query.
